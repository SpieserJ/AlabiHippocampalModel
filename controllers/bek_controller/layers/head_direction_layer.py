class HeadDirectionLayer:
    def __init__(self, num_cells: int) -> None:
        """
        Initializes a layer of head direction cells that represent the agent's heading in a discretized way.
        Each head direction cell has a preferred direction in space, and the activation of each cell is
        determined based on how close the agent's current heading is to the cell's preferred direction.

        The layer uses 'num_cells' head direction cells, evenly spaced across 360 degrees, and the activation
        of each cell is calculated using a dot product between the agent's current heading direction and the 
        cell's preferred direction.

        Parameters:
        - num_cells (int): The number of head direction cells in the layer, each representing a unique direction.

        Computes the activation of the head direction cells based on the agent's current heading direction. 

        Each head direction cell has a preferred direction, and this method calculates how much the agent's 
        current heading (represented by 'v_in') aligns with each of the head direction cells' preferred directions.

        The preferred directions of the head direction cells are evenly spaced across 360 degrees, and the 
        activation is calculated using the dot product of the current heading vector ('v_in') and the preferred 
        directions of the head direction cells.

        Parameters:
        - theta_0 (float): Heading angle of the anchor cue. Default is 0 degrees.
        - v_in (np.ndarray): A vector representing the current heading direction of the agent.

        Returns:
        - np.ndarray: The activation levels of the head direction cells, where each activation indicates how closely 
          the agent's current heading aligns with the preferred direction of each head direction cell.
